## Fade System

Fade was added to boxcutter as of version 714. It is a visual aesthetic for adjusting the fading of shapes on entry and exit.

> And we have been working on refining it ever since.

Shapes now have the ability to fade into view and fade out of view. This has resulted in a much more graceful experience. Great care was taken to improve stability in order to support this system.

# Fade Sound Effects (easter egg)

Setting the fade out to any of these times will activate a sound effect. 

> The numbers that activate them are set to be so random that general use would never uncover them.

We hope to expand this into something more musical and entertaining in the future.

> Fade sound effects also will active a forward / next button for easier fx jumping.

# Setting Fade Volume

As of (2.8)BoxCutter 714_10 a parameter for audio was added. If the user is on a fade value mentioned above a volume / sound device pref will be shown.

> Default volume is now 10% by default.

In the event sounds are not playing from Blender there could be an issue with the sound device specified. For that reason we expose that as well.

Extraction fade has also returned to Boxcutter after a time away.
