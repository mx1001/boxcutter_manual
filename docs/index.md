# How did Boxcutter come about?

Boxcutter was first created by [AR.](https://twitter.com/AdrianRutk0wski/) From the moment of this tools first inception we had great plans for it. Many have worked on this tool over the years but it wasn't until [proxe](https://twitter.com/proxeIO) rewrote things for 2.8 with the future in mind did we get closer to the dreams we never knew we had.

Boxcutter was an approach for a simpler more streamlined way to approach boolean modelling. HardOps had proven itself as focused workflow assistant and boxcutter was an attempt to reboot the whole idea with usability and simplicity in mind.

Boxcutter was first released April 26 2016. And from that moment it was a battle to survive.

From 2016 to this very moment we have been working on this tool and the refinement of the ideas we hope to convey. And to say the journey hasn't been "uneventful" would be an understatement.

Our competition is fierce but we're never one to give up.

These above posts chronicle our adventures throughout the boolean wars that still rage on to this day. The fires raging of events in the [b3d](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23b3d&src=typed_query) community still keeps up up late even years later.

As our work continues the wheels keep turning.
