<h2>What's New?</h2>

<h3>N Panel</h3>
Boxcutter can be started with clicking activate Boxcutter.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3499" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gwxgkokavn.gif" alt="gWXGkokaVN.gif" width="1717" height="1011" />

There was also some cleanup to make it more presentable and remove duplicate options.

In addition the help is also here so it is more accessible than before.


<h3>Slim Topbar</h3>
The topbar now has an option for a slimmer version. This can be more useful for mice users versus pens.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3496" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/8v9uhevbfj.gif" alt="8V9uHEVbFj.gif" width="1149" height="630" />
<h3></h3>
<h3>Extraction V1</h3>
Extraction has been added to Boxcutter however at this time it only takes boolean cut areas. This means if the area does not have a live boolean it will not be taken.

Here I cut a few circles in using dots to center subsequent circles in the face center.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3486" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/bool_setup.gif" alt="bool_setup.gif" width="1717" height="1011" />

Extractor can be switched to with Y during draw.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3488" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/9d5knvie3k.gif" alt="9D5KnvIE3K.gif" width="1717" height="1011" />

After an extraction the custom shape is then the extracted mesh. This allows for rapid use after extraction.

flip shape vertical - shift + F

rotate shape - R or ~ during draw

<h3></h3>
<h3>Ngon Cyclic</h3>
NOTE: Ngon cyclic does not support bevel yet. A special system will have to be made expanding on it.

Pressing C during Ngons toggles cyclic which can be used for creating imprint lines.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3489" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ugnmtqst7a.gif" alt="UGNmTQst7a.gif" width="1717" height="1011" />

To best explain how to use cyclic.

When in (C)cyclic mode you can double click the last point which will make the line darker. From here lazercut is active and the user can press T to add thickness to the shape.We hope to expand on its uses in the future.

<h3><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3508" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/xv8tggwqdi.gif" alt="XV8tggwQDi.gif" width="1717" height="1011" /></h3>

<h3>Classic Blue Box</h3>
If you draw the blue box in 2d which means not starting on the mesh you are able to use classic blue box from 79'. Classic blue box will cut into a surface and never create an interior face. The 3d version of blue box is still showing occasional issues that will be fixed in a  future release.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3491" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/wcfdjbcrxm.gif" alt="WCFDjBCRXm.gif" width="1717" height="1011" />

Blue box also has received an additional capability. Since knife project works with any type of edgework, with <strong>custom shape Blue box can cut custom geometry into other forms!</strong>

I have long wanted to cut grids into forms for deformation and now with Boxcutter it is easier than ever.

<h3>Array Improvements</h3>
When users complain about array we take it to heart. Too long has users pressed V and lost their arrays.

Press R during array to reset position and also to rotate the axis.

We have a more permanent solution planned but it will take a moment to execute.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3493" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/e3lyoeatwn.gif" alt="E3lyoEaTwN.gif" width="1717" height="1011" />

Array getting out of hand? Just press R during array to get it back under control.

Multidirectional multi grid array coming soon.
<h3></h3>
<h3>Mirror Improvements</h3>
Mirror has also received an improvement.

To mirror on X press 1 during draw. To flip the mirror press 1 again. To remove mirror press 1 again.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3494" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/hqyiqynr0n.gif" alt="HqYiQynr0n.gif" width="1717" height="1011" />
<h3></h3>
<h3>Bevel To Chamfer</h3>
If you bring the bevel in to 0 it will be changed to a chamfer and so forth.

<h3></h3>
<h3>Remesh sort</h3>
This one is odd but kinda fun.If you enable remesh under sort boxcutter will place bevels below. Now you can work in all quads... kinda. Multiple restrictions apply!

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3497" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/buvsieyris.gif" alt="buVsIEYRiS.gif" width="1717" height="1011" />
<h3></h3>
<h3>HOPS Back Bevel for BC</h3>
Usually BC has something HOPS wants but this time HardOPS is prepared for Boxcutter.

As of (2.8) HOps 0098_1 Californium_33 if you select a face and use Bevel in object mode (ctrl + click) it will flip the normal allowing for a nice back bevel.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3498" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ff4io5mb4e.gif" alt="ff4io5mb4E.gif" width="1717" height="1011" />

In the future this will be inherent in Boxcutter for use on the fly.
<h3></h3>
<h2>In closing</h2>
There were also a few additional quality of life improvements and bugfixes not worth mentioning but we still have a road ahead. <a href="https://gfycat.com/NastyNimbleArcticwolf">We are grateful to all who report bugs and post art to keep us motivated! </a>
