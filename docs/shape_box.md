# Shape: Box

I used to say box was all I needed. I have a fondness for the box but let's keep it formal.

Box does just what the name entails. It draws a box.

First is the draw. and then the extrude. Click and let go and click to apply.

> You can draw and extrude or you can draw click and just lazercut through the model.

# Modes

- [cut](mode_red.md)
- [slice](mode_yellow.md)

> Since extractions changes over to simple shape thats why the gif ended with custom shapes.

# Orientation

When an object is selected the default orientation should be object.

> The alternative is world and cursor.

# What is lazorcut?

Lazorcut is cutting without an extrude. It can either be done manually or with quick execute from the behavior panel.

> Quick Execute should definetely not be on by default.

# View Aligned cutting

This topbar button toggles view align cutting.

When it is on the box is draw from the view and not from the surface / cursor / world.

> View align is a throwback to our classic 2.7x beginnings.

# View align snap dot gotcha

When view align is on and you aren't aware the snapping dots on ctrl will behave differently.

This can be annoying until you realize view align up top is active. Just something to be aware of.
