# Custom Cutter Grid Cut

When started off the mesh surface and non extruded the knife will cut using knife project. This allows for grids and other patterns to be cut in meshes to assist with deformation.

In the following example I am using ctrl + A to convert to mesh and then use boxcutter to cut in a custom grid.

In conjunction with hardOps this can be useful with twist 360 or lattice deformation.
