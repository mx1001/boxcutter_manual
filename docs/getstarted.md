> It's also a nice place to report bugs and get noticed not to mention post art and chat!

# Applying booleans

You'll find in edit mode none of the booleans show if you have been working in non-destructive. As a result there is an option up top to apply booleans.

> You can even use boxcutter in edit mode.

# [Play with the various shapes](shapes.md)

[Box](shape_box.md), [Circle](shape_circle.md), [Ngon](shape_ngon.md) and custom are in boxcutter and can be a fun time for various things.
