## Getting Started

> **Alt + W** starts boxcutter with **W** closing it and switching tool

Boxcutter is intended to be a fun time drawing and cutting shapes.

Once boxcutter is enabled a new icon appears in the T panel.

# Exiting BoxCutter

> **W** exits boxcutter (this works by changing the active tool to select)

As of 2.8 Boxcutter is an active tool which means to exit the tool one must simply select another tool.

Fade is also new to 714 and dictates how shapes fade and appear. I recommend playing with high numbers and [even checking out the sound effects.](fade.md)

> It's also a nice place to report bugs and get noticed not to mention post art and chat!

# Applying booleans

![start](img/getstart1/g8.png)

Booleans can be applied using the button highlighted above.

You'll find in edit mode none of the booleans show if you have been working in non-destructive. As a result there is an option up top to apply booleans.

> You can even use boxcutter in edit mode. However it may have to be reactivated using the T panel icon or the **alt + W** hotkey.
