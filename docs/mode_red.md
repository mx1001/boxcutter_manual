# Applying booleans

While working in non-destructive booleans are kept live. You can apply them by using the apply booleans button in the topbar.

You may need to go back and delete the collection as well to delete the cutter shapes.

# Pause mode

In the corner of the topbar is a pause button that can let you pause the boolean operation for after confirmation. This can be useful when the viewport begins getting slow or there's performance issues.

# Classic Videos On Cut

When boxcutter was first ported to 2.8 only box and cut / slice was present. These videos serve as a nice history lesson and showing these features without all the additional extras.
