# Applying booleans

While working in non-destructive booleans are kept live. You can apply them by using the apply booleans button in the topbar.

# Pause mode

In the corner of the topbar is a pause button that can let you pause the boolean operation for after confirmation. This can be useful when the viewport begins getting slow or there's performance issues.
