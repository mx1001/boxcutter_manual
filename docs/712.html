As<a href="https://builder.blender.org/download"> Blender 2.8 </a>evolves further. Daily breakage has become a thing and with that we strongly recommend updating 2.8 before installing <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/BoxCutter">Boxcutter </a>712. We work around the clock to keep the tools working while also working towards their enhancement.

<h1>Installation</h1>
https://youtu.be/CG5fbgkeCyU

Place the folder from the zip in the local add-on directory.

C:\Users\YOUR USER\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.80\scripts\addons

Also remove any previous boxcutter folder before replacing it with the new one.

INSTALL FROM FILE CAN HAVE ISSUES IF THE FOLDER IS THERE ALREADY. PLACE THE ZIP IN THE SPECIFIED FOLDER TO ENSURE IT WORKS WITHOUT ISSUE. OR ENSURE THE FOLDER ISNT THERE AND USE INSTALL FROM FILE.

[caption id="attachment_3475" align="alignnone" width="1870"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3475" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/euuj6y2dbb.gif" alt="EUUJ6Y2Dbb.gif" width="1870" height="843" /> Placing the contents of the zip in the addon location[/caption]

The next level of support involves deleting the /config which makes Blender open as new. If you have issues with the previous steps or are moving over custom configurations this can cause issues if the properties have existed for multiple itterations of 2.8. From time to time removing the config allows for clean installation and quick startup.

<h2>Email</h2>
For support issues you can email me at masterxeon1001@gmail.com

However, I will also have you <a href="https://builder.blender.org/download">update Blender 2.8</a>.

Also the help icon in Boxcutter takes you to the discord which I recommend for all users looking for a community to connect to.

<h1>What's New?</h1>
<h2>Shape Recollection V1</h2>
When drawing a box or circle you can recall previous cutters in the cutter collection with alt + MMB or the C key.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3403" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/1nyymphy14.gif" alt="1nyYMpHy14.gif" width="1920" height="1084" />

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3424" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/whexslfqvk.gif" alt="wHEXSlFqVk.gif" width="1246" height="786" />

Shape recall only works with Box, and circle. Ngon will have a special solution for recall.

Shape recall is still a work in progress and could possibly throw an error until it is further refined. This is still an experimental feature.
<h2>Rotate 90 during draw</h2>
Pressing R or ~ (tilda) will rotate the recalled shape (alt + scroll) 90 degrees.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3404" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jmwobdyknw.gif" alt="jmwoBdyknw.gif" width="1132" height="762" />
<h2></h2>
<h2>Snapping V1</h2>
Snapping has been a heavily requested feature. Now it is present in the topbar, D pie and the Ctrl + D (box-helper).

When snapping is active dots will appear when Ctrl is held.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3405" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/blender_benvvf1xbu.png" alt="blender_BEnVvf1xbu.png" width="240" height="55" />

There are 5 snapping systems to choose from with one additional being tied to an orientation system.
<ul>
	<li>increment</li>
	<li>vertex</li>
	<li>edge midpoint</li>
	<li>face center</li>
	<li>viewport</li>
	<li>grid floor (with world orientation)</li>
</ul>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3406" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/lmtlw80v1z.gif" alt="LmTlw80v1Z.gif" width="1132" height="762" />

Proxe also took great care to ensure the dots fade out into the distance. He's a gem like that.

Snapping also works with active only. This is something I wanted personally however in the future we plan to add simple trace support as well.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3417" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/photiqjgg4-1.gif" alt="pHOtiqjgg4.gif" width="1132" height="762" />

The custom grid can even be snapped to.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3418" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/dvh6aan5ha.gif" alt="dVH6AAn5hA.gif" width="1246" height="786" />

In future updates we aim to expand the functionality and make it even more versatile.
<h2></h2>
<h2>Custom Cutter</h2>
Custom cutters is the biggest part of this release next to snapping. I am super excited to show what is next.

When no custom cutter is set the cutter will cut the Boxcutter logo. This can be useful for branding or just showing your Boxcutter spirit.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3407" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/61kyveomxk.gif" alt="61KYvEomXk.gif" width="1132" height="762" />

Any object can be a custom cutter.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3408" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/9wijtotcmn.gif" alt="9WIJTOTcMn.gif" width="1132" height="762" />

This has made for some interesting cutters.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3409" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/vue7l8usgk.gif" alt="vuE7L8uSgK.gif" width="1132" height="762" />

Users are also able to make a mesh a custom cutter by pressing C during custom cutter.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3444" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/bcyc2iw8bt.gif" alt="BcYc2iW8bt.gif" width="1920" height="1084" />

In the most recent update a parameter to flip the Join shape for custom has been added.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3446" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/blender_a4mqiwlpyz.png" alt="blender_a4MqIWLpYZ.png" width="253" height="261" />

Shift + F will also flip the shape vertical during draw.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3448" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/f5ke613kdj.gif" alt="f5ke613Kdj.gif" width="1920" height="1124" />

This is located in the ctrl + D helper at this time. (only when join is the active tool)
<h2>Self Cutting</h2>
If you mark the cube as the cutter and keep cutting it will exponentially change. This accident has led to some interesting results and is something I love trying daily.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3410" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/zt9zokx5g2.gif" alt="ZT9ZoKx5g2.gif" width="1132" height="762" />
<h2></h2>
<h2>Draw Changes</h2>
If you press and hold Alt during draw you can draw using center rectangle.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3411" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/9n1fligkss.gif" alt="9N1FlIgKsS.gif" width="1132" height="762" />

If you press and hold shift you will force it to constrain to a box shape.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3412" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/hy0psztjyx.gif" alt="Hy0PSZTjyX.gif" width="1132" height="762" />

Pressing both alt and shift will force it into a center draw.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3413" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/v2hsdbvvqa.gif" alt="V2HsdbVvqa.gif" width="1132" height="762" />

These behaviors might be a departure from previous releases so we had options to toggle these options as well. They can be found in the snap options.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3414" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/blender_hhtiyd8y33.png" alt="blender_hhTiYd8y33.png" width="231" height="60" />

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3415" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/blender_xwo1eg0vev.png" alt="blender_XwO1EG0veV.png" width="287" height="715" />

Also at the bottom of the behavior panel.
<h2></h2>
<h2>Auto-hide cutter toggle</h2>
For users who do not want their boolshapes to be hidden on subsequent drawings can choose to have them remain.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3419" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/p9soexfd69.gif" alt="P9sOeXfd69.gif" width="1246" height="786" />
<h2></h2>
<h2>Ngon Backspace</h2>
We are well aware of the amount of work needed to get Ngon back to where it was but a classic feature has been re-added. Backspace points.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3420" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jn6yiedgvq.gif" alt="jn6yIeDGvq.gif" width="1246" height="786" />
<h2></h2>
<h2>Mod Sort Level 2</h2>
Modifier sorting is our goal for the 2.8 era of tools. With modifier sort level 2 now the sorting will behave properly when multiple bevel modifiers are in place on objects.

Special care was taken to make sure it supports the bevel mod properly as well as added a few additional modifiers to sort.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3421" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/ecep5snfce.gif" alt="eCEP5snFce.gif" width="1246" height="786" />

This means that if you have deep levels of bevels you can work on the lowest level. In the future we hope to allow users to choose a level and even promote boolshapes up and down levels.
<h2></h2>
<h2>Cutter UVs</h2>
Cutters now have UVs for situations where uvs are needing to be transferred. This is still a wip and we hope to expand it in the future.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3422" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/6xv0jfhcfw.gif" alt="6Xv0JFHcfW.gif" width="1246" height="786" />
<h2></h2>
<h2>Initial Custom Hotkey</h2>
The alt + W hotkey can be remapped. We plan to add full support for the keymap in the future as it becomes more concrete and the systems are more complete.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3423" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/blender_2fitoawvpf.png" alt="blender_2FiToaWvpF.png" width="507" height="288" />
<h2></h2>
<h2>Edge Data Preservation</h2>
A user reported a strange issue to us that showed us boxcutter contained an issue with edge marked data that HOPS did not.

Previously boxcutter removed edge data and now that has been fixed.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3445" src="https://masterxeon1001.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jgggmy4sqj.gif" alt="jgggmy4sqj.gif" width="1920" height="1084" />

Wrapping up a release always means... videos.

<h2>In Closing</h2>
<h1><a href="https://gumroad.com/l/DECALmachine/">DECAL MACHINE</a> IS OUT FOR 2.8!!!!! *dies*</h1>
We hope you enjoy the latest update. We have more to come and even more to go back over with refinement and behavioral fine tuning. I look eager to user input of feature request improvements and to see what custom cutters you come up with for Boxcutter!

<a href="https://gumroad.com/l/hopscutter">Hopscutter </a>is a 24 hour operation but also we enjoy the work we do and the results users show! We hope to keep you cutting as long as possible!
