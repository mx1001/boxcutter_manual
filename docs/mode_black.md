Hotkey >> Y (during draw)

Extract is intended to take the underlying surface and convert it into a cutter.

As of 71V extract is also capable of taking surfaces.

# Edit Mode Extract

Extraction can be used in edit mode which will switch to custom cutter with the resulting extraction.

# Using active Only as a jumpoff point

Active only seems useless however not being able to cut the secondary selection and instead use it for obtaining orientation is a powerful feature.

I used object scroll from hardOps to get the cutter for the main cylinder that I used to orient my extraction to. I tend to start in red just to see what I'm going to take disappear and then press Y to toggle before application to extract.
