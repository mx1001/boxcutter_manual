It is with great pleasure that we release <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/BoxCutter">Boxcutter 714: Fadeblade</a>. This brings a few changes to the way things work as well as additional functionality. Without further ado let's go over what is new.



<a href="https://boxcutter-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dots/">Docs have been updated. </a>

<a href="https://boxcutter-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/">Installation</a>


<h2>Help icon in topbar</h2>
Now the help icon is in the topbar to make <a href="https://boxcutter-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shape_box/">accessing the documentation easier</a>. As users ask questions we hope to expand on it to automate the learning process of hopscutter.

<h2>Fade V1</h2>
Shapes now have the ability to fade into view and fade out of view. This has resulted in a much more graceful experience. This was the most time consuming portion of 714. Great care was taken to improve stability in order to support this system.

Fade times are in milliseconds. Set to low numbers to disable.

Fade adds shape afterfade for lazorcut, greybox, and repeat.

Fade can be adjusted via behavior panel or prefs.
<h2>Extraction Hide</h2>
Previously extractions would remain in user view. That has now been resolved making for a smoother experience. Also the shading of extractions have been improved making them better for use with kitops.

<h2>Behavior Panel >> Display Additional Options</h2>

In the behavior panel fade options were added from prefs for changing fade options on the fly. Also simple topbar was added for simplifying the topbar while working if preferred.


<h2>Accucut</h2>
Accucut is a new system extending lazorcut's accuracy.

When using lazorcut in the previous versions it always overshot.

The new version makes it closer to the dimensions of the mesh.

<h2>Dots Edit Mode</h2>
Dots are back in Boxcutter 714.

When drawing a shape users can tab to live. During live dots exist for Extrude, Offset, Draw and Bevel.

Click the shape to apply.

The draw dot utilizes shift, ctrl and alt draw for fine adjustment of the draw being uniform, center, or corner.

Dots extend to the other shapes in varying degrees.

With circle the diameter and bevel can be changed.

<h2>Rounded Snap Dots</h2>
Dots for snapping are more rounded. Resulting in a nicer appearance.

<h2>Radial Array</h2>
Pressing V goes into array. Pressing V twice launches radial array.

The radial array can be shifted to live for movement and fine modification.

Since radial array is live and uses modifiers it starts at 3 at this time. In the future we plan to extend on the functionality of this tool and give it a proper start operation.

Array supports all shapes and modes.

<h2>Knife Box Display</h2>
I am a big fan of knife box however without wire showing it's potential is misunderstood.

Now wires will show when knife is in use. Allowing you to see what is being cut and how the underlying geometry is being affected.

On completion wires will be turned back off.

<h2></h2>
<h2>Edit Mode Circle No Tris</h2>
I am particular about circle not having interior points. Now in edit mode circle no longer leaves center points.

Keep in mind you can not only cut in edit mode but radial array in edit mode and not to mention being able to shift to live from edit mode to object mode and still modify the asset.

<h2>In closing</h2>
I am excited for the next horizon for Boxcutter. So much almost made it but had to be cut for time on this release. Alot of things planned for next time so don't count us out just yet. We even wanna show you one last thing to try.

Set the fade out time to any of these numbers.

I hope everyone enjoys this latest release. We can't wait to see you guys fading real slow.
